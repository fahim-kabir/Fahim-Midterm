When does the story of British art begin? A publisher has asked me to write a new history of British art, and I need to find out. There is some debate over whether the most cited “earliest British artwork”—15,000-year-old incisions into cave walls at Creswell Crags in Derbyshire—actually constitutes a man-made, creative act. But wherever the first British art is to be found, it will almost certainly be found in stone. We have no cave paintings in Britain. Very few items made on organic matter, such as bone, have survived. So I spent much of January looking at rocks.



How fascinating they are. The most mesmerising are “cup and ring” marks. These are made of a central cup cut into the stone, surrounded by a series of shallower rings, like ripples on water. Seen en masse they have a captivating rhythm. Fortunately, I live in one of the best parts of the country for exploring them, on the border between England and Scotland. Fought over for thousands of years, but never industrialised, it is a land of prehistoric ghosts, littered with neolithic and bronze age remains. All you need to find these little epicentres of British art is an Ordnance Survey map and a raincoat (but it helps if, like me, you’re married to an archaeologist).



In Northumberland we visited the largest single panel of prehistoric rock art in Britain, at Roughting Linn. Few know about it, and it has never been excavated. Near an impressive waterfall, an enormous sandstone rock, 20 metres long, breaches the earth like a whale rising for air. It is covered with more than a hundred cup and ring marks. Some are linked by channels cut into the rock, others are embellished with sun-like rays round their outer edge.
